# ML Math with Densworld
## Mathematical Foundations for Machine Learning

---

*"The Tribunal demanded evidence. 'Show us,' they said, 'how you know this manuscript is false.' I could not simply declare it—I needed mathematics that would stand before the court."*
— Mink Pavar, the Great Forgery Trial of 912

## Overview

This course teaches the mathematical foundations of machine learning through the lens of Densworld—a fictional world of archives, expeditions, and strange creatures. You'll learn real math skills while exploring manuscript forgery detection, creature classification, and expedition outcome prediction.

### Why Fictional Data?

1. **You must actually learn the methods**—no copying solutions from Stack Overflow
2. **The data tells a story** that rewards careful exploration
3. **Domain knowledge matters**—understanding what a "yeller group" is helps you analyze the data

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

1. **Derive algorithms from first principles** — not just memorize them
2. **Diagnose model problems** — underfitting vs overfitting
3. **Apply regularization** with mathematical understanding
4. **Evaluate models properly** using cross-validation

---

## The World of Densworld

This course draws from Densworld, a fictional archive spanning fantasy, noir, and contemporary layers. Key figures include:

- **Mink Pavar**: Reclusive scholar who exposed the Great Forgery
- **The Colonel**: Commander besieging the Tower of Mirado for 20 years
- **Boffa Trent**: Natural philosopher cataloguing creatures
- **Vagabu Olt**: Wanderer whose observations inform expedition planning
